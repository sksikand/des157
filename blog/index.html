        <p> Google Drive is a productive platform.
          Functionally, the ability to collaborate, edit,
          and access files from anywhere are incredibly
          helpful for my lifestyle. </p>

        <p> On basic functions, the service performs very
          well. It's straight to the point and gets the job
          done. New updates include version control, where
          uploading files of the same title to the same directory
          rewrites the previous version to the latest. Now users
          don't have 5 of the same file names.<p>

        <p>However, there are several points of tension
          on a deeper level. </p>
